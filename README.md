# Servlet Learning using Projects

This repository is a collection of projects demonstrating the use of Java Servlets. Servlets are a key component of Java EE technology used for building web applications.

## Overview

Java Servlets are server-side Java program modules that process and answer client requests and implement the servlet interface. They are powerful tools for building dynamic, data-driven web applications.

This repository serves as a learning resource for anyone interested in getting started with or advancing their knowledge in Java Servlets.

## Projects

The projects in this repository cover various aspects of Java Servlets, from basics to more advanced topics.

1. **Basic Servlet Implementation**: This project is a simple implementation of a servlet demonstrating the basic servlet lifecycle.
2. **Servlet with Database Interaction**: A project demonstrating a servlet interfacing with a database using JDBC.
3. **Servlet with JSP**: This project shows how to use Java Server Pages (JSP) with servlets to build dynamic web pages.

## Setup and Execution

To run these projects, you need to have Java and a server like Apache Tomcat installed. Import the projects into your preferred IDE (like IntelliJ or Eclipse), and run them on your server.
